## PokePath TD: INFINITE v1.4.4

**Compatible with PokePath TD v1.4.4** ✅

### What's New in Latest Update
- **Reworked challenge level cap** — Level cap now works as a true maximum: high-level Pokemon are capped down, low-level Pokemon keep their actual level. Players can still level up freely during challenges (stats/display capped, leveling banks for after)
- **Fixed star emoji rendering** — Stars now display correctly in HUD (player panel & route indicator)
- **Fixed challenge unlock in endless mode** — Challenges no longer lock out after surpassing wave 100
- Stripped UTF-8 BOM from all mod files to prevent encoding issues
- Updated mod installer to prevent BOM-related encoding bugs in future
