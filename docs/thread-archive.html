This isn't about 'modding for fun', it's about sharing unofficial tools and altered versions publicly, which can mislead players and harm the project. I'm simply clarifying that the post is not official.</div>

That's why the ban happened.

What we don't tolerate on our official platforms is taking someone else's code and modifying it (in this case, clearly AI-generated) and then promoting it publicly without permission. This is a matter of respect for the creator and the work behind the project.

As already stated, we can't and don't forbid people from doing this elsewhere. If people choose to play your version, that's their decision and their responsibility.

Our only intention was to clearly state that your post was not official, and that we are not responsible for unofficial tools or modified versions. That clarification has now been made.</div>

When you spend a thousand hours making it in the first place. I will clarify more on my post and in github that we are not affiliated.

We agree that the rules can be made clearer, and we will update them accordingly. That said, we would have appreciated it if you had contacted a staff member first to ask for permission before joining the Discord for the first time and posting a link.

In my post on your discord i said, i wasnt sure if this was allowed but here it is, and was instantly banned. I can feel you are defensive and trying to damage control, but just be chill. community mods of your game are an indication of success, not a threat. I would have appreciated to be let known of the unclear rules upon my offense, rather than banishment, though i do understand, your viewpoint as a dev myself. Im not just some kid with AI. If allowed back into the community, i would be happy to share some ideas.</div>

However, joining the Discord to promote an unofficial alternative version of the game in the general channel, without prior contact with the staff, is not something we can allow on our official platforms.

The only thing we ask is that it's made very clear that it's not official, to avoid confusion. We regularly get people coming to our official channels with issues like corrupted saves or bugs caused by unofficial versions, which we obviously can't control or support.

For that reason, while modding itself isn't forbidden, sharing or promoting unofficial versions on our official channels isn't allowed.

This isn't about fear of mods or AI, just about clarity, respect for the original work, and protecting players from confusion.</div>

        <div class="comment-body">You think I would have spent time to do any of this, if I didnt appreciate the work itself, which is a deviation to begin with. I think its pretty clear when someone says, "hey I modded this game heres the link" with no server badge, its probably unofficial. btw all of your posts so far appear more AI than my code. and prompted to not understand any point I make xD</div>

        <div class="comment-body">The donation option comes from itch itself, the creator isn't asking for money, and the game can be downloaded and played entirely for free.

The official website has no ads and no monetization of any kind. This is simply a fan-made project created by passionate people, like many other fan games.</div>
